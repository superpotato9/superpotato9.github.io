<h3> US providing aid to South Korea </h3>
  <p> In 1946 after WW2, American troops occupied South Korea in order to provide aid and prevent hunger and disease. Starting in 1949, the US started providing financial and government aid for the country. America made a mutual defense treaty with South Korea after the Korean War ended. America also remains a form of trade for South Korea. The aid America gave to South Korea allowed it to rebuild itself. It went from being one of the poorest countries to receive aid to being one of the top 20 richest countries.
     </p>

  <h3> Middle East </h3>
 <p> Following the September 11 attacks on America, a terrorist group from Saudi Arabia, Al Queda, was blamed for the deaths. This event gave a new prominent mission for America to “Spread their greatness” and involve themselves in other countries to spread the culture of America. America created the Bush doctrine, issuing a war on terrorism. When Afghanistan regfused to reveal where Osama Bin Laden was hiding, they launched air strikes and forced themselves into power. Military bases were soon created in order to facilitate military action.
   </p>
<h3> The Vietnam War </h3>
<p> America first intervened in Vietnam when communism began to spread. They wanted to protect South Vietnam from being forced into communism. Areas in Vietnam were heavily bombed as America strived to kill as many enemy troops as possible rather than trying to secure territory. While they were able to greatly reduce the numbers of the North Vietnam army, they also caused some of the American public to start distrusting the government and the reason for the war. Due to the development and popularization of camera and film, people saw the horrors of war with their own eyes, causing a stark change in the way war and the military was seen.
   </p>
  <h3> Central America </h3>
<p>US intervention began to cause many deaths in Central America. They facilitated the murders and torture of political opponents around multiple countries. America controlled Central America in order to continue their financial gain. The US led a military-led coop in Guatemala in order to overthrow President Jacobo Arbenz due to their fear that he would increase wages and lower the money the US made from Guatemala. The US also poured billions of dollars into El Salvador in order to fight off communism. They also trained Salvadoran military officials at a school in Georgia.
   </p>
    <h3> Libya </h3>
<p>The United States intervened in Libya in order to prevent the presence of ISIS in Libya and to allow Libya to protect its civilians. ISIS had been involved with Libya after the 2011 Libyan Civil war, which caused instability that ISIS was able to take advantage of and take control. The US conducted airstrikes and drone strikes to Libya from November 2015 to 2019 in order to combat ISIS. The US was able to kill Abu Nabil, a senior ISIS leader. The aftermath was ISIS’s control was significantly diminished. However, they did not fully eliminate the presence of ISIS. Libya remains unstable politically and the Libyan Civil War was continued after the intervention of the US.

      <h3> Somalia </h3>

<p>In 1991, the Somali dictator Siad Barre was overthrown, leading to a power vacuum that caused conflict between rival warlords. This conflict caused severe famine and millions of Somalis facing starvation. The US launched Operation Restore Hope in 1992 in response to the humanitarian crisis. The goal of this mission was to deliver aid and create a safe environment for the aid workers. The mission eventually shifted from humanitarian aid to peacekeeping and rebuilding the nation. In 1993, the Battle of Mongadishu took place, resulting in the deaths of 18 US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis. This event led to the withdrawal of the US forces in Somalia. Somalia remained unstable and conflict continued. Since the 2000’s, the US has maintained a pretense in Somalia to combat terrorism, specifically with the Al-Shabaab terrorist group

<h3>The CIA in Guatemala 1950’s  </h3>
<p> In 1950 Guatemala had elected Arbenz as their president to continue socio-economic reforms of the country, the CIA was strongly against this saying: “"[Guatemala has] an intensely nationalistic program of progress colored by the touchy, anti-foreign inferiority complex of the 'Banana Republic.” The US had two attempts at overthrowing a president in Guatemala, the first was codenamed Operation PBFortune and was a collaboration with the Nicaraguan dictator Anastacio Somoza. The operation was multi-faceted and involved Political action, psychological warfare, Murder, and subversion. Among the methods used by the CIA, executive action of individuals that were deemed to need to be neutralized (through murder, imprisonment, or exile) was carried out on 58 individuals. The second operation: PBSuccess was relied more on psychological and political control and according to the CIA no assassinations were involved in the operation. Instead “the power of the CIA's psychological-war, codenamed "Operation Sherwood," against Arbenz rendered that option unnecessary.” However, after Arbenz’s resignation the final stage of PBSuccess was implemented, it called for the murder of communist or sympathizers, while no true estimates exist many human rights organizations estimate the number of people killed by successive regimes is close to 100,000 civilians.

<h3>The CIA in Tibet </h3>
<p> The CIA had a long spanning history of involvement in Tibet during the cold war. However, all the involvement revolved around the goal of containing communist China and stopping the spread of communism in Asia. During 1957 Tibet was having its sovereignty increasingly diminished by China so, to combat this the CIA took steps to help the Tibet militia, for example the CIA selected 8 Tibetan to be trained then dropped back into the country to both carry out counters against China and to collect intelligence. The CIA also dropped weapons into the country, mainly: rifles, machine guns, and ammunitions. However these drops proved unsubstantial and did not contribute to the war meaningfully. There were a couple reasons for this, for one the CIA gave them WWI era weapons that did not match the modern day firing power of the Chinese, the weapons were also improperly packed and consequently many broke during the air drops. So mixed with a small pile of weapons that had been diminished further by human error the stock did not meet the needs of the Tibetan resistance (which was now of considerable size). As the airdrops continued the CIA also took more Tibetan soldiers and attempted to use them for recon purposes. These also proved to be largely a failure. Mutiple missions are known to have been conducteda only one had succeeded (more on that later). All of the failures could easily be attributed to lack of planning on the CIA side as in every case the missions were either abandoned for environmental reasons or the combatants were captured and killed. Of the failed missions famously only one succeeded known as the blue satchel raid, The missions was indented to dismantle a caravan of Chinese soldiers but ended with the CIA coming into possession of sensitive Chinese military material, this included governmental opinions of the cultural revolution, the nuclear power of China, and other sensitive matters. Much of this information went directly against pentagon intelligence and showed the intelligence reconnaissance powers of the CIA.
